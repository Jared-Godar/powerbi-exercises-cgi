## Introduction

### Learning objectives

- Describe what Power BI is and how it's used by organizations
- Describe how Power BI connects to data sources
- Build and share a basic Power BI report and dashboard
- Administer Power BI permissions, licensing, and row level security

- Power Business Intelligence, otherwise known as Power BI, is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.
  - Connect to your data sources.
  - Visualize (or discover) what's important.
  - Share that with anyone or everyone you want.

### Functionality

- Datasets. A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
- Visualizations. A visualization (also referred to as a visual) is a visual representation of the data in a dataset, like a chart or a color-coded map. Power BI has all sorts of visualization types. The goal of a visual is to present data in a way that provides context and insights.
- Reports. A report is a collection of visualizations, based on a given dataset, that appears together on one or more pages.
- Dashboards. A Power BI dashboard is a selected group of visuals that originate from one or more reports and provide quick insight into the data or story being presented. A dashboard must fit on a single page, often called a canvas.

### Power BI Components

- A Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
  - The Power BI Desktop is a free application that users can install on their local computers that lets them connect to, transform, and visualize their data.
  - With Power BI Desktop, users can connect to multiple sources of data and combine them (often called modeling) into a data model.
- An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service.
  - The Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) is a cloud-based suite of business analytics tools.
  - It lets users connect to, visualize, and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding.
- Mobile Power BI apps that are available on Windows phones and tablets, and Apple iOS and Google Android devices.
- A common flow of work in Power BI begins in Power BI Desktop, where a report is created. That report is then published to the Power BI service and finally shared, so that users of Power BI Mobile apps can consume the information.

### Administer permissions, licensing, and row level security in Power BI

- Global admins and Power BI service admins can see the following tabs in the admin portal:
  - Usage metrics. Usage metrics enable the admin to monitor the organization’s Power BI usage. It also indicates which users and groups are the most active within Power BI.
  - Users. Power BI users, groups, and admins are managed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This tab provides a link to the admin center in the organization’s tenant.
  - Audit logs. Power BI audit logs are managed in the Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center (SCC). This tab provides a link to the SCC for the organization’s tenant. To use audit logs, admins must ensure the Create audit logs for internal activity auditing and compliance setting is enabled.

### Connect Power BI to data sources

- Data is at the heart of Power BI. Power BI can connect to data by using standard connectors to data sources, such as:
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Salesforce
  - Microsoft Dynamics
  - Azure Blob Storage
- Power BI can also connect to generic data sources, such as:
  - ODBC
  - OData
  - OLE DB
  - Web
  - CSV
  - XML
  - JSON
