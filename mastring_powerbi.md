## Chapter 1: Understanding the Basics

### Understanding Business Intelligence

- Before defining **Business Intelligence**, lets define data and information:
  - *Data* can be anything.
    - Text, numbers, or images in digital format.
    - Raw, unorganized, or arbitrary
    - Once loaded, transformed, processed and interpreted to create meaningful and contextual information.
  - In the business world, *data* and *information* are often used interchangeably.
  - BI relates to the technologies and techniques to collect and categorize an organization's data and presents meaningful information in a format that helps better decision making.

#### Advantages of a BI system

- **Information Broadcasting** delivered in a visual format understangable to user - dashboards, tables, charts, and maps.
- **Secure Delivery** Need-to-know basis
- **Adhoc analysis** self-service BI applications to perform own data analysis

#### Business Intelligence components

- **Data Sets** DB, cloud, excel, csv, etc
- **Extract,Transform, Load (ETL)** Process of data integration to combine disparate data from multiple sources. Build a data warehouse.
- **Data Warehouse** Process of managing large data in an organization. Assist in BI tasks. 
  - Relational Database to store and manage data
